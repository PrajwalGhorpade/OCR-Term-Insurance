OCR-Term Insurance is a project designed to streamline the process of extracting and managing data from scanned insurance documents. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, this tool converts scanned images and PDFs of insurance policies into structured, machine-readable text. This enables efficient data extraction, organization, and analysis for insurance providers, agents, and policyholders.

- Data Structuring: Automatically organizes extracted data into structured formats such as JSON or CSV for easy integration with other systems.
- Field Extraction: Identifies and extracts specific fields like policy numbers, coverage details, dates, and personal information.
- Batch Processing: Supports batch processing of multiple documents to save time and improve efficiency.
- Customizable Templates: Allows customization of templates to handle different document layouts and formats.
